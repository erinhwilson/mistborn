- having trouble just recreating http://bl.ocks.org/jose187/4733747#graphFile.json on my own computer

- tried running from a local server on my own computer because otherwise it wouldn't let me load a local file...
	- python -m http.server
	- opened localhost:8000/network.html

- force function seems outta whack... switched to forceSimulation?

- current error says force.nodes/force.links is not a function... but clearly this is used in other code.

- poop

- apparently some combination of just restarting the server/ re=-copy pasting made it happy to display a network.

- now I'm having trouble making the source and target refer to node ids instead of the index in the nodes list

 - net2 uses id names but can't drag or change weight

 - net3: sometimes the d3 viz decides to stop responding to changes in the .json file... but renaming it fixes... caching somehow?

 - next steP: how do I make the dual arrows?

 Current status:
 - Made network force diagram with real mistborn eyebrow data from book 1
 - run from python -m http.server
 - net3.html is current best
 - got data into json in ipynb 
 - data = eyebrow_network.json
